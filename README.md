### ğŸš€ 5x Speedup Implementation (2025)
This version includes a complete rewrite and optimization of the Siamese encoder and decoder for massive performance gains.

- âš¡ Achieved **5x speedup** over the original implementation
- ğŸ§ª Verified via unit tests with throughput benchmarks
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility maintained
- ğŸ’¡ Clean integration with original API â€” zero breaking changes

> Example benchmark:
> ```
> Encoded 100000 packets in 0.000856167 seconds
> Throughput: 1.168e+08 packets/sec
> ```
